<h1>About Lexi</h1>
<p>Lexi is a tool for documenting new and existing languages. She has the ability for anyone to browse any languages that have been added already. Users have the ability to signup for an account, and once logged in, they can then be a collaborator of an existing language or create their own language. For now, a language consists of a name, a description, and a list of words (a lexicon). Users have the ability to add words to a language including the text of the word, the translation, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) format of the word to help in pronunciation, and a sentence example.</p>
<p>Here are some instructions:</p>
<p>1. The Home Page lists the languages that have been added to the site. You may click on a language name to see its lexicon. Next to each language is a brief description of the language as determined by the language creator or anyone that is a collaborator.</p>
<p>2. A big red "Sign Up" button is also located on the home page. Click this and create a simple account. Your email must be a valid email format, and your password must be at least 6 characters long. Once your account is created you will be directed back to the Home Page. However, now you will see buttons and links to be able to create a "New Language" or "Edit" an existing language. You also have the option to "Delete" any languages.</p>
<p>3. Once logged in, if you click the language name of a language, you will now see buttons and links to create a "New Word" or "Edit and "Delete" any existing words.</p>
<p>4. After you have created or modified any languages you can then logout. Feel free to share the Project URL with anyone. Have fun and create a language with your friends or family.</p>
